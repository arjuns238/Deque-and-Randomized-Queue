# Deque-and-Randomized-Queue

Implementation of Deque and Randomized Queue using a linked list and a resizing array.

Dequeue - A double-ended queue or deque is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. 
The methods supported are isEmpty(), size(), addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast(), iterator()
Each operation is supported in constant worst-case time.

Randomized queue - A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.
The methods supported are isEmpty(), size(), enqueue(), dequeue() {remove and return an item at random}, sample() {return a random item (but do not remove it)}, iterator() {return an independent iterator over items in random order}
Each randomized queue operation (besides creating an iterator) is supported in constant amortized time.
